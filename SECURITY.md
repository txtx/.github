# Reporting Security Issues

At Txtx, we are dedicated to building developer tools for blockchains.

Ensuring the safety and security of our products is of utmost importance to us. We highly value the contributions of external security researchers and appreciate their invaluable efforts in enhancing the security of the Stacks ecosystem.

If you have discovered a bug or vulnerability in any of our products, we encourage you to [report it by email](mailto://team@txtx.builders). 

We will work closely with you to investigate and resolve the issue promptly.
